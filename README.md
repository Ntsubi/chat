## Dependencies 
- React Native 
-- Gifted Chat, Navigation, AsyncStorage, Stack Navigator, Maps
- Expo
- Google Firebase Database & Storage

## Usage
Please follow these steps to get Chat up and running: 
- Clone the repository
- Install Node.js. To avoid any potential conflicts, it is recommended to run `nvm use 16.19.0` in the terminal
- Install Expo by running `npm install -g expo-cli` 
- Download the Expo Go app on your mobile and open 
- In the terminal run `npm start` or `expo start` from the project directory

The messages and images shared will need to be stored somewhere. For this purpose, Google's Firebase is the storage solution. Using a Google Account, sign in and set up a Firestore Database. 
Important pointers during set up: 
- create your database in production mode
- navigate to the "Rules" tab and edit `allow read, write: if false` to `allow read, write: if true` and click "Publish" to save the changes
